Object Detection AI Model for Edge Devices

Overview

This project implements an AI-powered object detection model using Edge Impulse on an ESP-EYE (ESP32-based camera module). The model is optimized for low-power edge devices and utilizes FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) to detect multiple objects in real-time with minimal computational overhead.

Features

Edge AI Integration – Runs inference directly on ESP32 without cloud processing.

FOMO-Based Object Detection – Efficiently detects multiple objects with low latency.

Optimized Image Processing – Uses JPEG compression, RGB888 conversion, and QVGA resolution for memory efficiency.

Real-Time Inference & Monitoring – Captures images, processes data, and classifies objects instantly.

IoT-Ready – Suitable for smart surveillance, industrial monitoring, and AI-powered security systems.
